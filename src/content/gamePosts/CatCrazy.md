When a bad day gets worse, an unwillingly retired Debra finds herself in the quaint village of Tabbietown.  After crossing paths with a cute calico (literally) she finds herself with the newfound ability to talk to cats. She is soon drawn into the town's mystery, hunting a lost treasure with her new feline friends while finding the family she never knew she needed.

## Features:
Choose from 3 interchangeable feline sidekicks every time you leave the house, each with their own personality, dialogue, and backstory.

Meet and befriend over a dozen cute and charming kitties.  Scratch their backs, and they might return the favor.

Freely explore Tabbietown and the surrounding areas such as Blasted Lake, The Tabbietown Mine Experience, Smithers' Farm, the beautiful church, and more.

Get immersed in solving a mystery left by the town's founder - a family feud, a lost treasure, and long hidden clues.

Concentrate on solving the clues, or take your time and get to know friendly townsfolk with evolving dialogue.

No time constraints or combat, for a cozy and relaxing experience.

Cat Crazy has around 3-5 hours of semi-linear story and gameplay.

The game's replayability comes from using different cats and doing quests in different orders!
